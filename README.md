The implementations and the report were made for the first assignment of the course Parallel Computing at Radboud University, cohort 2018.
The task was to create a sequential version, an OpenMP version and an MPI version for the given Heat Diffusion algorithm, and then try and optimize the different versions. In the report we analyze the runtime effects of the changes we have made.
